### Description

My Vi-IMproved configurations, forever tweaked and tinkered with over many years. You'll also find two color schemes which I created from scratch, some snippets, and a few simple plugins I've written. What mainly differentiates my setup from others', seems to be that I don't use _any_ plugins except those I've written myself. I also have zero interest in Neovim.

This setup pairs very well with [AutoExec (AE)](https://github.com/terminalforlife/Extra/tree/master/source/autoexec).

If you wish to ask me any questions or otherwise discuss Vim, check out the Discussions tab.
